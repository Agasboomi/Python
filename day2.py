# variable A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored.
#  We use underscore character after each word for a variable containing more than one word(eg. first_name, last_name, engine_rotation_speed).
#  When we assign a certain data type to a variable, it is called variable declaration. 

# print('Hello world')
# print(len("hello"))

# first_name = "karthi"
# print("first_name")

# name = input("Enter Your name : ")
# print(name)
# age = input("enter your Age : ")
# print(age)

# age = 23453454
# print(age)

# num_int = 10
# print('num_int',num_int)
